# Assignment 7 : The Great Firewall of Santa Cruz: Bloom Filters, Linked Lists, Binary Trees and Hash Tables

In this assignment, we will use series of coding alghorithms, to correctly take a text (oldspeak) and translate it to a new text.
In other _words_ (pun intended :) ), it is a program that censors forbidden texts and replaces it with alternative words.
